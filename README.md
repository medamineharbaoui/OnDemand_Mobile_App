# OnDemand Service Reservation App (in French)

# Introduction

This is a Flutter-based mobile application that provides a streamlined platform for clients to browse, book, and manage reservations for various services, while service providers can manage client requests and view completed tasks. It also includes an admin dashboard accessible via a web interface for managing categories, services, and complaints. (Check my other repos for the dashboard).
The app is built using Flutter for the frontend, providing a smooth and responsive user experience across both iOS and Android devices.
